# MengerianMoney
An open source project for building a plausible simulation of how spontaneous money could have come about in pre-historic communities. 
## Inspiration
"Mengerâ€™s theory of money: some experimental evidence" by Peter G.Klein and George Selgin.
## Why Build Another Simulation?
1. Klein's and Selgin's paper describes a simulation of a simple market made up of agents that start with only one kind of thing ("good") to sell in the market. Here we start off with each agent having more than one thing to offer.
2. I believe visualization can make the simulation much more interesting and easier to understand; this can then imbue some pedagogical value to the resulting simulation.
3. It would be coold to put such visualization on the front page of the RockStable website, and maybe other websites.
